AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> SRR389222_sub1.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	100000	0.00
Nextera	0	CTGTCTCTTATA	100000	0.00
Illumina	0	AGATCGGAAGAGC	100000	0.00
Unable to auto-detect most prominent adapter from the first specified file (count smallRNA: 0, count Nextera: 0, count Illumina: 0)
Defaulting to Illumina universal adapter ( AGATCGGAAGAGC ). Specify -a SEQUENCE to avoid this behavior).
