 *** Bismark methylation extractor version v0.23.0 ***

Setting core usage to single-threaded (default). Consider using --multicore <int> to speed up the extraction process.

Summarising Bismark methylation extractor parameters:
===============================================================
Bismark single-end SAM format specified (default)
Number of cores to be used: 1
Output will be written to the current directory ('/Users/nirvaanreddy/Desktop/CURVE/work/9b/3802b2b1856992b6e3f4aad2eb6a85')


Summarising bedGraph parameters:
===============================================================
Generating additional output in bedGraph and coverage format
bedGraph format:	<Chromosome> <Start Position> <End Position> <Methylation Percentage>
coverage format:	<Chromosome> <Start Position> <End Position> <Methylation Percentage> <count methylated> <count non-methylated>

Using a cutoff of 1 read(s) to report cytosine positions
Reporting and sorting cytosine methylation information in CpG context only (default)
The bedGraph UNIX sort command will use the following memory setting:	'2G'. Temporary directory used for sorting is the output directory
