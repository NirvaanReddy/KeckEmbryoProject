Processing single-end Bismark output file(s) (SAM format):
SRR389222_sub1_trimmed_bismark_bt2.bam


If there are several alignments to a single position in the genome the first alignment will be chosen. Since the input files are not in any way sorted this is a near-enough random selection of reads.
