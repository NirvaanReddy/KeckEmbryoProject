Bowtie 2 seems to be working fine (tested command 'bowtie2 --version' [2.4.2])
Output format is BAM (default)
Alignments will be written out in BAM format. Samtools found here: '/opt/conda/envs/nf-core-methylseq-1.6/bin/samtools'
Reference genome folder provided is BismarkIndex/	(absolute path is '/Users/nirvaanreddy/Desktop/CURVE/work/81/987dabc711d2b8f97bc938e5fb1f4f/BismarkIndex/)'
FastQ format assumed (by default)

Input files to be analysed (in current folder '/Users/nirvaanreddy/Desktop/CURVE/work/a3/1e3d91305a3b965fbef146cd3f2867'):
SRR389222_sub2_trimmed.fq.gz
SRR389222_sub2_trimmed.fq.gz
Library is assumed to be strand-specific (directional), alignments to strands complementary to the original top or bottom strands will be ignored (i.e. not performed!)
Setting parallelization to single-threaded (default)

Summary of all aligner options:	-q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals
