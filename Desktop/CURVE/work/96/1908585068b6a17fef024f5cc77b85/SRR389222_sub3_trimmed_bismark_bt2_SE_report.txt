Bismark report for: SRR389222_sub3_trimmed.fq.gz (version: v0.23.0)
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /Users/nirvaanreddy/Desktop/CURVE/work/81/987dabc711d2b8f97bc938e5fb1f4f/BismarkIndex/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequences analysed in total:	79877
Number of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments:	39627
Mapping efficiency:	49.6%
Sequences with no alignments under any condition:	40250
Sequences did not map uniquely:	0
Sequences which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequences with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/CT:	39616	((converted) top strand)
CT/GA:	11	((converted) bottom strand)
GA/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
